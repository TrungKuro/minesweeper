/**
 * Generates a new Minesweeper board with the specified dimensions and mine count.
 *
 * The board is represented as a flat array of Cell objects. Mines are randomly
 * distributed across the board, with the option to exclude a specific cell
 * (typically the first cell clicked by the player).
 *
 * After placing mines, the function calculates the adjacentMines count for each
 * non-mine cell based on the number of mines in the 8 surrounding cells.
 *
 * @param rows - Number of rows in the board
 * @param cols - Number of columns in the board
 * @param mines - Total number of mines to place on the board
 * @param excludeId - Optional cell ID to exclude from mine placement (e.g., "0-0")
 * @returns A flat array of Cell objects representing the game board
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * // Generate a 9x9 beginner board with 10 mines
 * const board = generateBoard(9, 9, 10);
 *
 * // Generate a board excluding the first clicked cell
 * const board = generateBoard(9, 9, 10, "4-5");
 * ```

/**
 * Reveals all connected cells starting from a given cell using flood-fill algorithm.
 *
 * When a cell with 0 adjacent mines is revealed, this function automatically reveals
 * all connected cells that also have 0 adjacent mines, and their immediate neighbors.
 * The flood-fill stops at cells with adjacent mines (numbered cells) or flagged cells.
 *
 * @param board - Current game board as a flat array of cells
 * @param rows - Number of rows in the board
 * @param cols - Number of columns in the board
 * @param startId - The ID of the cell where the flood-fill should start
 * @returns A new board array with the revealed cells updated
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * // Reveal connected cells starting from cell "3-4"
 * const newBoard = revealFlood(currentBoard, 9, 9, "3-4");
 * ```
